        <h3>Programming Experience</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><em><strong>Software Engineering Project</strong></em> (<a href="https://wheeldriveusedcardealership.web.app/index.html" target="_blank">https://wheeldriveusedcardealership.web.app/index.html</a>) – Students put in a professional setting working in a team of six. 5 months to complete the project while each student had their own professional role. I took on the job of a Software Engineer and developed the back-end of our project using JavaScript. I ended up learning the job of a Full-Stack Software Engineer by helping other students in their roles. The outcome of this project helped me learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Google Firebase, and how to create documentation for our web app.</li>
            <br>
            <li><em><strong>Personal Project</strong></em> (<a href="https://www.thefixmua.com" target="_blank">https://www.thefixmua.com</a>) – Creating a React Web App for my wife’s makeup and nail portfolio. Using techniques like the React Router library to create a smooth user experience by keeping the UI in sync. In order to display my wifes portfolio, I used Instagram Basic Display API from Meta for Devs. I generated a token from my wife’s Instagram business profile and pulled images from her posts. This allows her to post a picture on Instagram and automatically upload to her web app portfolio. This makes it really convenient and quick to keep her portfolio up to date without having to upload any images to a database. App is both desktop and mobile compatible.</li>
